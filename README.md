# Project: Working with SQLite Database

In this project, we'll be working with the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of facts about countries. The Factbook contains demographic information for each country in the world, including:

population - The population as of 2015
population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage
area - The total land and water area
You can download the Factbook as a SQLite database from GitHub if you want to work with it on your own computer. In this project, we'll be working with Python and the SQLite command line tool (SQLite Command Shell) to connect to the database, extract data, and perform analysis on the data.
